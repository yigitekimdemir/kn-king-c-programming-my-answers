I was never good in card games and these poker projects were just too much for me, because i am not that proficient either in the English
language or poker. So I just skipped them.

Also, 7th project was way too hard IMO for a learner at Chapter 10. Without practicing about less digits before, it is
almost impossible to comprehend.
